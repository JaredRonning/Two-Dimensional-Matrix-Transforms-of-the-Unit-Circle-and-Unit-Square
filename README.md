# Two-Dimensional-Matrix-Transforms-of-the-Unit-Circle-and-Unit-Square
This project takes a given 2 by 2 matrix and plots two figures for the matrix transforms from a discrete set of points lying on the unit circle and unit square. Written in MATLAB.
This branch excludes the lines connecting initial points to transformed points.
